/**
 * It is a finite sequence of instruction, 
 * which when followed, 
 * accomplishes a particular task. 
 *--* 
 *? Desirabel properties of algorithm:
 ** Input ->
    zero or more inputs are externally supplied
 ** Output ->
    At least one quantity is produced
 ** Finiteness -> 
    No matter what, the algo must terminate 
    after finite amount of time.
 ** Definiteness -> 
    Each instruction of the algorithm must 
    be precise and unambiguous
 ** Effectiveness -> 
    Every instruction must be so 
    basic that it can be carried out 
    by a person with  paper and pencil.
 *--*   
 *? Algorithm Complexity -> 
 ** Space Complexity: 
    Amount of computer memory it takes during it's execution
 ** Time Complexity: 
    Amount of computer time it takes during it's execution
 *--*
 ** Instance-Independent Algorithms ->
    Have time complexity of O(1)
 ** Instance-Dependent Algorithms
